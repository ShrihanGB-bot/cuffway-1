  # CuffWay | Smart Support for Respiratory Recovery

  This is the CuffWay landing page code bundle. The original design inspiration is available at https://www.figma.com/design/npcNihpphohkMese6IBcou/Startup-Medical-Device-Landing-Page.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
  

## Deploying to Vercel

This project uses Vite and builds into the `build` folder (see `vite.config.ts`). To deploy on Vercel:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In the Vercel dashboard, import the GitHub repository.
3. Vercel will use the `vercel.json` in the repo which runs `npm run build` and serves the `build` directory.

If you need to set environment variables or custom rewrites, add them in the Vercel project settings.
